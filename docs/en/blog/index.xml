      <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>We just published our first version of the Gatekeeper Documentation for <a href="https://docs.gatekeeper.page/admin/">administrators</a>, <a href="https://docs.gatekeeper.page/user/">users</a>, and <a href="https://docs.gatekeeper.page/developer/">developers</a>. Check it out at <a href="https://docs.gatekeeper.page/">docs.gatekeeper.page</a>.</p>

<h1 id="finding-the-right-documentation-software">Finding the right documentation software</h1>
<p>We had a few criteria for the right documentation software. Those being:</p>
<ol>
<li>Community members can contribute without hassles.</li>
<li>Data can be accessed using open formats.</li>
</ol>
<p>While we initially considered going with <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx</a>, the experience isn&rsquo;t quite where we want it. Installing it isn&rsquo;t straight forward, and reStructuredText isn&rsquo;t intuitive to many people.</p>
<p>We ultimately settled on <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/">GitBook</a>. Despite it not being an open-source solution, it offers us the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular contributors can edit the documentation using the GitBook web UI.</li>
<li>Non-regular contributors can edit the documentation by making a Pull Request on GitHub.</li>
<li>GitBook provides hosting for us. And since we are an open-source project, this even <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/pricing">for free</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As GitBook stores the data using Markdown in GitHub, there is also not much vendor lock-in. Any potential migration to other services in the future should thus be easily possible.</p>
<h1 id="helping-contributing">Helping contributing</h1>
<p>We&rsquo;d be happy for any contributions to our documentation. Just submit a Pull Request or Issue to our GitHub repositories, and we&rsquo;d happily incorporate your changes.</p>
<ul>

      <title>Gatekeeper in a Snap</title>

      <description><![CDATA[ As described in our earlier post: &ldquo;SaaS ate the world.&quot;. You don&rsquo;t need to bother with long installation processes, backups, let alone deploy updates timely. How can we get to a state in which on-premise software can compete with this?]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>As described in our earlier post: &quot;<a href="https://gatekeeper.page/en/blog/2020-why-is-there-a-need-for-gatekeeper/">SaaS ate the world.</a>&quot;. And one of the reasons for that is the fact that it is easy.</p>
<p>You don't need to bother with long installation processes, backups, let alone deploy updates timely. In the cloud, someone else is doing all this for you.</p>
<p>How can we get to a state in which on-premise software can compete with this?</p>
<h2 id="appliances-done-right-are-rare">Appliances done right are rare.</h2>
<p>Many software projects tend to offer appliances for download.</p>
<p>While this often allows for an easy installation, it doesn't solve the problem of updates. And that is what many appliances get wrong. They still require significant technical knowledge to be updated and maintained. (you get to update the operating system <strong>AND</strong> the software).</p>
<p>The sad reality is that many of these appliances get installed once and never updated. Not even for critical security vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 id="meet-snaps">Meet Snaps</h2>
<p><a href="https://snapcraft.io/">Snaps</a> are containerized software packages. Compared to standard Linux packages (e.g., .deb), they are executed in a <a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/security-sandboxing">sandbox</a> but have full control over the container.</p>
<p>Besides, Snaps are <a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/keeping-snaps-up-to-date">automatically kept updated</a> and read-only by design. There's only a single folder that you need to update. And you don't have to take care of software updates at all.</p>
<p>Installing Snaps is also ridiculously easy. You have to run a single command. For example, to install Gatekeeper, all you have to do is run the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">sudo snap install gatekeeper
</code></pre></div><p>And within less than a minute, you should have Gatekeeper installed and will automatically receive all security updates.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-this-all-work">How does this all work?</h2>
<p>In case you are interested how this all works, we have published <a href="https://github.com/getgatekeeper/gatekeeper-snap">our Snap package on GitHub</a>. In a nutshell, what it currently does is:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/GetGatekeeper/gatekeeper-snap/blob/cdde9398d38bbde07109cc0c745a414eec2321ad/snap/snapcraft.yaml#L2">Define Ubuntu 18.04 as base operating system</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/GetGatekeeper/gatekeeper-snap/blob/cdde9398d38bbde07109cc0c745a414eec2321ad/snap/snapcraft.yaml#L37-L57">Compile the frontend and backend of Gatekeeper</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/GetGatekeeper/gatekeeper-snap/blob/cdde9398d38bbde07109cc0c745a414eec2321ad/snap/snapcraft.yaml#L67-L83">Compile PostgreSQL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/GetGatekeeper/gatekeeper-snap/blob/cdde9398d38bbde07109cc0c745a414eec2321ad/snap/snapcraft.yaml#L86-L98">Start PostgreSQL and Gatekeeper</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If we ever decide to add additional dependencies, you don't have to worry about this. Snap will take care of all that for you.</p>

      <title>Why is there a need for Gatekeeper?</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>I wrote down some of the reasons for the creation of the Gatekeeper project. Gatekeeper aims to be an open-source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management">Identity Access Management solution</a>, done in a way that anyone can run it.</p>
<h2 id="self-hosting-requires-it-knowledge">Self-hosting requires IT knowledge.</h2>
<p>In 2016 a friend of mine started a startup. They asked me for advice on what internal systems they should use for their company to keep their data away from the cloud.</p>
<p>As co-founder of <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a>, my initial advice was to give that a try for document management.</p>
<p>Shortly after, they asked me: &quot;What if we want to create email accounts, chat accounts, and more?&quot;</p>
<p>What should I have recommended them at this point? Nextcloud doesn't support all of these features, and they wanted a single login for all those features. And indeed, you can't teach everyone how to administrate an LDAP and SAML server.</p>
<p>So instead, they ended up using Google Apps for Business and Slack. From an end-user perspective, this is all great. Everything works with a few clicks.</p>
<p>It's December 2020, and instead of more open-source projects popping up to solve these problems, the opposite happened. SaaS ate the world.</p>
<h2 id="open-source-projects-lack-iam-support">Open-Source Projects lack IAM support.</h2>
<p>We ended up in a world where open-source projects often lack support for Identity Management systems. At the same time, proprietary and hosted software like <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-uk/help/articles/212572638-Manage-members-with-SCIM-provisioning">Slack</a>, <a href="https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/security/supported-identity-providers">Dropbox</a>, or <a href="https://www.workplace.com/resources/tech/account-management/automatic/">Facebook Workplace</a> supports these.</p>
<p>There are just a few open-source projects with official support for Identity Access Management (IAM) Systems. How did we end up with this state?</p>
<p>I believe the main reason boils down that there is no simple-to-use, easy-to-install open-source access management solution. There are many expensive Enterprise systems but barely do open-source maintainers have access to these.</p>
<p>The lack of such software leads to many downstream issues, such as the lack of high-quality open-source libraries for IAM support.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-gatekeeper-fix-this">How does Gatekeeper fix this?</h2>
<p>We can try to get to a state where more open-source projects will support IAM standards by creating an open-source Identity Access Management solution.</p>
<p>Gatekeeper aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be easy to install and maintain.</li>
<li>Be secure by default.</li>
<li>Be easy to use.</li>
<li>Offer toolings and guidance for other software to implement IAM standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully, that will lead to a world in which a button press will create users on all the software you desire to use. Be it on-premise or SaaS.</p>
